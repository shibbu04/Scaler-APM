    "name": "user_name",

### Conversation Memory

## Response Personalization

### Dynamic Content Insertion
```javascript
// Example personalized responses
const responses = {
  withName: "That's a great question, {name}! Here's what I recommend...",
  withCareer: "For {careerGoal}, the typical path is...",
  withExperience: "Given your {experienceLevel} background, I'd suggest...",
  withTimeline: "Since you want to transition {timeline}, here's an accelerated approach..."
};
```

### Conditional Logic
```yaml
if_conditions:
  experienced_developer:
    condition: "currentRole contains ['developer', 'engineer', 'programmer']"
    response: "With your coding background, you're already ahead of the game!"
    
  career_changer:
    condition: "currentRole not contains ['tech', 'engineer', 'developer']"
    response: "Career change can feel overwhelming, but you're not alone! 60% of our students come from non-tech backgrounds."
    
  urgent_timeline:
    condition: "timeline equals 'ASAP'"
    response: "I love the urgency! Let's create an aggressive timeline that works."
```

## Fallback Handling

### Unknown Intent
```yaml
fallback_responses:
  - "I'm not sure I understand. Could you rephrase that?"
  - "Interesting question! Can you tell me more about what you're looking for?"
  - "Let me connect you with a human expert who can better help with that specific question."
```

### Error Recovery  
```yaml
error_recovery:
  invalid_email:
    response: "That doesn't look like a valid email address. Could you double-check it for me?"
    retry_limit: 3
    
  connection_issues:
    response: "Sorry, I'm having technical difficulties. Let me try that again..."
    fallback_action: "escalate_to_human"
```
